# Yelp Help
A purely front-end web app that extends the functionality of Yelp. Uses Google APIs to give users useful search parameters when looking for a place to eat.  
 Users input type of food desired, distance willing to travel (in minutes), and method of transportation they want to use. Origin location is determined automatically or manually via user input. Results are displayed on an interactive map, can be sorted by price, time to travel, or Yelp ratings. Directions can be obtained once a choice is made.  

 Now browsing is more mobile friendly
